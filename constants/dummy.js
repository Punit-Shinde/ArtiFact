At some point, Dr. Vegapunk extracted a sample from a captive Kaidou's Lineage Factor and, with it, created an artificial replica of this Devil Fruit, though the result was deemed a failure; said replica was eventually consumed by Kozuki Momonosuke, who gained a dragon transformation similar to Kaidou's (albeit pink and not azure)",

However, during transport, it was stolen by Shanks and his crew. Shortly after, it was accidentally eaten by the series' protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.",
